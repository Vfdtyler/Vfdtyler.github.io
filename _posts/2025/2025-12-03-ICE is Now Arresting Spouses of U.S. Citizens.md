The New York Times:
> It was supposed to be a celebratory milestone, the final step in the process to obtain U.S. permanent residency. Instead, as each interview with an immigration officer wrapped up, federal agents swooped in, handcuffed the foreign spouse and took him or her away.

> But the couples and their lawyers said they had followed the required steps: They had submitted extensive paperwork and paid fees. The foreign spouses had been fingerprinted and passed medical exams. None had criminal records. None had entered the country illegally. They had already been granted employment authorization.

I think ICE has realized that it's actually somewhat difficult to find undocumented immigrants because those people are purposely trying to evade the system. On the other hand, documented immigrants are, well, documented. These are people who are trying to do things the right way. This means that they're in the system, there's records of their homes and their workplaces, and they have meetings set up with immigration officers. If your job is to deport people and your boss is demanding that you get your numbers up, it's much easier to arrest someone when you know exactly where they're going to be at a specific time.

They said they were only going after people who were here illegally. They said they would start with the violent criminals. They said they just want people to come into the country the right way. They lied about everything.
