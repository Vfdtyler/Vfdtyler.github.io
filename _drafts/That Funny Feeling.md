title: There It Is Again, That Funny Feeling
---

Apple announces new iPhones with better and higher quality cameras, and the next day we witness a political assassination recorded with cameras on people's phones. It’s like this reminder that people use their smart phones to do a lot of things, but increasingly one of those things is to film horrific tragedies and post them on the internet. But hey, at least it’s in 4K.

Julia Alexander wrote a piece about the shooting called “[A Generation Posting Through It](https://postingnexus.substack.com/p/a-generation-posting-through-it)” and this part stuck out to me:

> One video I came across showed a TikTok creator filming people running from the shooting site, taking about 40 seconds to show the horrifying chaos surrounding students in attendance, but ending on a “make sure you subscribe” message.

For me, this is what Bo was talking about when he talks about his movie, *Eighth Grade*:

> This movie is not about, like— it's not a Ted Talk. It's not telling you what to think. It's going, like, this is sort of how I think it feels; this is how the internet registers to me in my tummy.

That’s one of the other things she talks about in the piece is how people are more likely to engage with stuff that makes you angry or upset. And how that’s also kinda how Charlie Kirk got famous, debating people on college campuses for the purpose of farming clicks. And then the exact same thing happened when he was killed: it was used for content. It comes full circle in this really weird way.

I’m not even trying to analyze like what parts of this are good or bad, it’s just a weird thing to process emotionally.
